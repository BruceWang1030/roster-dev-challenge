## Decision-making during the challenge

Throughout the development process, I opted for the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) as it's an excellent choice for creating lightweight, full-stack web applications. While I considered using GraphQL, I ultimately decided against it since the Node.js backend proved to be relatively concise.

When it came to the user interface design, I leveraged Material UI to enhance the aesthetics of the table. For deployment purposes, I utilized AWS services, including S3, EC2, and MongoDB, ensuring a seamless and efficient deployment experience.
